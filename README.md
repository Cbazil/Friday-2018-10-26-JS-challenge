- CHALLENGE ONE - Made a if Function, so when number is great then 0 it will change the number into a negative one
  added var number = to function and number you want to change would be placed in the perenthesis eg 18 will change to -18 due to function arithmetics
- CHALLENGE TWO - Mapped Arrays, Setted the 4 arrays, const map()name = function() array.map(x => x * 3(any int) )
  Multiples the 4 arrays but the int you add int the array.map, Called the answer
